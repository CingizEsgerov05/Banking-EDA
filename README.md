## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow for the banking domain using:
- **Python** for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis
- **SQL** for structured data storage and SQL queries
- **Power BI** for dashboard and visualization

The goal is to explore customer and transaction behavior, detect trends and outliers, and provide insights through visual storytelling.
